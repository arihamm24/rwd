          <p> Addition is the manner by which we combine numbers in mathematics. It is represented by the plus sign (+).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To add, you take one number and decide how many places down a number line you will move it forward</li>
              <li><code> 2 + 2 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 3  + 1 = 4</code></li>

        <header>Subtraction</header>
          <p> Subtraction is the manner by which we decrease numbers in mathematics. It is represented by the minus sign (-).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>To subtract, you take one number and decide how many places down a number line you will move it backward</li>
              <li><code>5 - 2 = 5 - 1 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 </code></li>

        <header>Multiplication</header>
          <p> Multiplication is the manner by which we compound numbers in mathematics. It is most commonly represented by an irregular sign (in programming we use "*" ).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Multiplication is repeated addition! When you multiply a number by a factor, you simply add that number to itself however many times the factor is.</li>
              <li><code>3 * 3 = 3 + 3 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9</code></li>
            </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Division">
        <header>Division</header>
          <p> Division is the manner by which we combine numbers in mathematics. It is frequently represented by a fraction bar (/).</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Division is repeated subtraction! When you divide a number by a factor, you simply subtract that factor from the original number until you get 0. However many times you subtracted is your answer</li>
              <li><code>6/2= 6 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0</code></li>
              <li><code> 6/2 = 3</code></li>

          <p>These concepts build on the basic arithmetic operations, but they may take some time to master.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Remainders (Division)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Sometimes when we divide, the quotients will not be round numbers and we will have leftover values. Those values are called <strong>remainders</strong></li>
                <li><code>45/8 = 5 r5</code></li>
                  <ul><li><code>8 * 5 = 40</code>, but we're still 5 shy of 45. That makes 5 a remainder!</li></ul>
              </ul>
            <li>Exponents (Multiplication)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Exponents are repeated multiplication. When a number is being operated with an exponent, it is being <strong>"raised to a power"</strong></li>
                <li><code> 2 ^ 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8</code></li>
              </ul>
            <li>Negative Numbers (Subtraction)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>When you are first taught subtraction, you are told numbers cannot go below 0, meaning you cannot subtract a larger number from anoter smaller number (i.e. <code>3 - 5</code> cannot be solved). In higher math, you learn about negative numbers, which throw this rule out the window.</li>
                <li><code> 3 - 5 = 3 - 3 - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2</code></li>
              </ul>
          </ol>
